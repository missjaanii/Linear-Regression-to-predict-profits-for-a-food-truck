# Linear-regression-to-predict-profits-for-a-food-truck
Here I have implemented linear regression with one
variable to predict profits for a food truck. The CEO of a
restaurant franchise is considering different cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and data for
profits and populations from the cities.

This data can be used to help select which city to expand
to next.
